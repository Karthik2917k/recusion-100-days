# Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary LeetCode 1491

You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the ith employee.
Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.


## Example 1:
```
Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500
```
Example 2:
```
Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
Output: 2000.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000) / 1 = 2000
```

```JavaScript
var average = function(salary) {
    const min = Math.min(...salary)
    const max = Math.max(...salary)
    let minMax = min+max;
    const salarysum = salary.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,0);
    const tsum = Math.abs(salarysum-minMax)
    const length = salary.length-2;
    const avg = tsum/length;
    return avg.toFixed(5);
};
```
